        <li> Are the HTML tags and elements the same thing?</li>
        &#10146;No, HTML tags and elements are not the same thing.
        <li>What are tags and attributes in HTML?</li>
        &#10146; HTML tags are used to define the structure of a web page. They are enclosed in angle brackets and
        consist of a tag name. HTML attributes provide additional information about HTML elements. They are always
        specified in the start tag and usually come in name/value pairs like: name="value".
        <li>What are void elements in HTML?</li>
        &#10146; Void elements are elements in HTML that cannot have any child nodes (i.e., nested elements or text
        nodes). Void
        elements only have a start tag; end tags must not be specified for void elements.
        <li>What are HTML Entities?</li>
        &#10146; Html entities are used to display reserved characters,special characters or invisible characters.
        <li>What are different types of lists in HTML?</li>
        &#10146; There are three types of lists in html,there are:- <br>
        <ol type="a">
       <li>Ordered list or Number list.</li>
       <li> Unordered list or bullet list. </li>
      <li>Description list or definition list.</li>  
    </ol>
        <li>What is the ‘class’ attribute in HTML? </li>
        &#10146; The class attribute is used to specify one or more class names for an element. The class attribute is
        mostly used to point to a class in a style sheet.
        <li>What is the difference between the ‘id’ attribute and the ‘class’ attribute of HTML
            elements?</li>
        &#10146; The id and class attributes are used to specify the style and behavior of HTML elements, but they have
        different purposes and behaviors: <br>
        1.Id Attribute: The id attribute is used to identify a unique HTML element on a web page. It should be unique
        within the entire HTML document. The id attribute is often used in JavaScript and CSS to style and manipulate
        specific HTML elements. For example, you might use an id attribute to identify a specific section of a webpage
        that you want to highlight with a particular color or font size. An id attribute can be used only once within a
        single HTML document. <br>
        2.Class Attribute: The class attribute is used to specify a group of HTML elements that share the same style or
        behavior. Multiple elements in HTML can have the same class value, and a single HTML element can have multiple
        class values. The class attribute is often used in CSS to apply styles to groups of HTML elements. For example,
        you might use a class attribute to specify a set of links that all share the same background color or font size.
        <li>What are the various formatting tags in HTML?</li>
        &#10146; There are several formatting tags in HTML. Some of the most commonly used formatting tags are: <br>

        b [tag is for bold text] <br>
        em [tag is for italicized text] <br>
        u [tag is for underlined text] <br>
        sup [tag is for superscript text] <br>
        sub [tag is for subscript text]

        <li>How is Cell Padding different from Cell Spacing?</li>
        &#10146; Cell padding is the space between the cell content and its border. It is defined using the cellpadding
        attribute of the <table> tag. <br>

            Cell spacing is the space between two adjacent cells in a table. It is defined using the cellspacing
            attribute of the <table> tag.
                <li>How can we club two or more rows or columns into a single row or column in an HTML
                    table? </li>
                &#10146;You can merge two or more rows or columns into a single row or column in an HTML table by using
                the rowspan and colspan attributes. <br>

                1.The rowspan attribute is used to merge or combine the number of cells in a row. <br>
                2.The colspan attribute is used to merge column cells in a table.
                <li>What is the difference between a block-level element and an inline element?</li>
                &#10146; 1.Block-level elements always start on a new line and take up the full width available. <br>
                2.Inline elements do not start on a new line and only take up as much width as necessary.
                <li>How to create a Hyperlink in HTML?</li>
                &#10146;To create a hyperlink in HTML, you can use the (a) element. The (a) element stands for “anchor,”
                and it is used to create a hyperlink to another web page or a specific location on the same
                page. <br>
                ((a) href="#">Click here to visit module: 2 (html)(/a))
                <li>What is the use of an iframe tag?</li>
                &#10146;The HTML (iframe) tag specifies an inline frame. An inline frame is used to embed another document within the current HTML document.
                <li>What is the use of a span tag? Explain with example?</li>
                &#10146;The HTML (span) tag is an inline container used to mark up a part of a text or a part of a document. <br>

                </b>
                <li> How to insert a picture into a background image of a web page?</li>
                &#10146;To insert a picture into a background image of a web 
                page, you can use the CSS background-image property. 
                You can specify the background image in the (style)
                element, in the (head) section.
                <li>How are active links different from normal links? </li>
                &#10146;An active text or graphic link on a Web page. Clicking the 
                link redirects the user to another Web page or a document 
                or image. Live links are also placed into email, allowing 
                recipients of the message to immediately go to a website or 
                open an attached document or image. <br>
                The default color for normal and active links is blue. Some 
                browsers recognize an active link when the mouse cursor is 
                placed over that link; Others recognize active links when the 
                link has the focus. Those that don't have a mouse cursor over 
                that link is considered a normal link
                <li>What are the different tags to separate sections of text? </li>
                &#10146;There are different tags that can be used to separate 
                sections of text. The (br) tag is one way to separate the 
                lines of text.
                <li>What is SVG?</li>
                &#10146; Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) is an XML-based vector 
                image format for defining two-dimensional graphics, 
                having support for interactivity and animation.
                <li> What is difference between HTML and XHTML? </li>
                &#10146; The main difference between HTML and XHTML is that XHTML is a stricter and more standardized
                version of HTML. XHTML is based on XML, which means that it has a stricter syntax compared to HTML. <br>
                XHTML requires that all tags be closed properly and that all elements be nested correctly.
                <li>What are logical and physical tags in HTML?</li>
                &#10146;Physical and Logical tags are used in HTML for better 
                visibility and understanding of the text by the user on the 
                web page. However, both tags differ from each other as 
                suggested by their names. Logical tags are used to tell the 
                browser what kind of text is written inside the tags.
